# Fuzz

## Scope

- `Converters`: Implements conversion rules to generate valid `Vyper` sources from the `proto` messages

- `Generators`: Interacts with `atheris` fuzzer engine and `converters` to generate `Vyper` source codes and their input values for execution

- `Runners`: Executes generated source codes with provided input values

- `Verifiers`: Manages the validation of test results, ensuring that generated code behaves consistently across compiler versions and configurations.

## Workflow

1. **Test Case Generation**: The `generators` module produces `Vyper` source codes using `converters` module based on structured `proto` templates and compiler coverage.

2. **Task Distribution**: With `QueueManager` handling task distribution, each runner instance retrieves a task from the queue and processes it independently, allowing the fuzzer to scale across multiple workers.

3. **Test Case Execution**: The runners module listens for tasks in the queue. When a test case is retrieved, the runner compiles and executes the `Vyper` code using the specified compiler configuration via `titanoboa`.

4. **Result Verification**: The verifiers module retrieves results and checks them for consistency across compiler versions, identifying potential bugs or inconsistencies.
