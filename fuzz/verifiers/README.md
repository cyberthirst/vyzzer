# Verifiers

The verifiers module is responsible for validating the outputs generated by the fuzzing framework, ensuring that the `Vyper` compiler behaves consistently across different inputs, versions, and configurations.

## Scope

- [`verifier_api.py`](verifier_api.py): Implements the `VerifierBase` class, which manages the process of validating results against expected outputs, and logging any inconsistencies.

- [`simple_verifier.py`](simple_verifier.py): A basic script that runs a continuous verification loop using the `VerifierBase` class.

## Overview

The `verifier_api.py` implements a straightforward approach of verification via direct comparison. This logic could be altered by overriding/implementing the `*_verifier` methods of this class.
